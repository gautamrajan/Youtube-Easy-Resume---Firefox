# YTAutoResume

A chrome extension that adds auto-resume functionality to Youtube videos. Videos will automatically resume from where you left off last, and in-progress videos are displayed through a pop-up window. Includes configurable settings that allow the user to determine which videos automatically resume, and adds a toggle control to the Youtube player.
